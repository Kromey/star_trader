# This file defines the Jobs available for Agents
# This file should be a list of items in the following format:
#   - name: 'Job Name'  # String name of the Job
#     limit: 2          # (Optional) Maximum number of Job runs in a round
#     inputs:           # (Optional) List of Goods required to perform this Job
#       - good: 'Good'  # String name of the Good
#         qty: 1        # Integer number of units required
#       - good: 'Another Good'
#         qty: 2
#     outputs:          # (Optional) List of Goods produced by this Job
#       - good: 'Good'  # String name of the Good
#         qty: 1        # Integer number of units produced
#       - good: 'Another Good'
#         qty: 2
#     tools:            # (Optional) List of Tools required by this Job
#       - tool: 'Wrench'# String name of the Tool
#         qty: 1        # How many are needed to perform the Job
#         break_chance: 0.1 # Percent chance (as a float) that the Tool will break
# NB: If either of inputs or outputs are omitted, the Job will not require or
# produce (respectively) any Goods. If BOTH are omitted, well, it's probably a
# pretty useless Job, isn't it?
# Omitting the tools list likewise means that no tools are required to perform
# the Job. Tools are in fact Goods, so when adding a Tool be sure there is a
# corresponding Good as well.
