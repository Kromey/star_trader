# This file defines the Jobs available for Agents
# This file should be a list of items in the following format:
#   - name: 'Job Name' # String name of the Job
#     limit: 2         # (Optional) Maximum number of Job runs in a round
#     inputs:          # (Optional) List of Goods required to perform this Job
#       - good: 'Good' # String name of the Good
#         qty: 1       # Integer number of units required
#       - good: 'Another Good'
#         qty: 2
#     outputs:         # (Optional) List of Goods produced by this Job
#       - good: 'Good' # String name of the Good
#         qty: 1       # Integer number of units produced
#       - good: 'Another Good'
#         qty: 2
# NB: If either of inputs or outputs are omitted, the Job will not require or
# produce (respectively) any Goods. If BOTH are omitted, well, it's probably a
# pretty useless Job, isn't it?
